<p class="p8"> I am actually quite laid back when it comes to free time, I don't really do a whole lot. When I have free time
I like to...</p>

<ul>
<li>Play Video Games</li>
<li>Watch Youtube</li>
<li>Watch the Red Sox/Patriots Games</li>
<li>Hang out with friends</li>
<li>Go on dates with my girlfriend</li>
<li>Enjoy alone time</li>
<li>Go to the movies</li>
</ul>

<p class="p9"> It doesn't take to much to entertain me, I'm usually either just playing some video games, watching something
that I find interesting, or I'm somewhere in Bangor, Maine doing the same things over and over again. Sometimes I do enjoy
going somewhere that I usually don't go a lot however. I don't mind taking a day trip to Bar Harbor, Maine or Portland, Maine
because they have so much more to do than we do around central Maine. However out of all the things I do during my free time
I mostly spend that with my girlfriend because it's my favorite thing to do. It doesn't matter what we are doing, as long as we are
together and that's all I need in life, just somebody to make me laugh and have a good time with.</p>
