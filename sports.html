<p class="p1">Sports have been a huge part of my life. Growing up I always was playing sports, mainly baseball,
basketball, or football. When I was young these were the only sports I played. I played on teams and just with
friends on the playground. As I got older however I grew apart from football, and got into playing soccer.</p>

<p class="p2">Growing up I always hated soccer and wanted nothing to do with it, but my eighth grade year I decided to try it out
and actually ended up loving it. If it weren't for growing up playing baseball and loving baseball so much
when I was younger, soccer would have been my favorite sport.</p>

<p class="p3"> In high school I ended up only sticking with baseball and soccer, my two favorite sports and
actually had quite an impact on both sports at my high shcool.</p>

<ul>
<li>Baseball: I was a starter for the varsity team my freshmen year and played left field, and quickly became
an important player. After my freshmen year I became the centerfielder and was one of the best centerfielders in the state,
 and by my senior year I broke the record for stolen bases with 72.</li>
<li>Soccer: I only played JV my freshmen year, which was only my second year of soccer since I started in eighth grade. My sophomore year I was
going to be a full time Varsity player, but in preseason I broke my leg. After recovering, I did play on varsity, and by my senior year I was scoring
goals left and right, and ended up leading the team with goals my senior year.</li>
